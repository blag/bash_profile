The aliases set in this file are intended to be consistent across operating
systems and environments.

Any aliases that begin with `__` (double underscores) are ignored by Git.

Any variables that are set on a per-OS basis should be explicitly aliased in
the OS config, not here.

Technically these files are just Bash scripts and can be anything, but it
it would probably be wise to keep them as simple as possible.
